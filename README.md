# Software that runs on DZOS

This is a repository of programs I develop (or adapt in the case of MS BASIC) for my homebrew computer *dastaZ80* running my own operating system [DZOS](https://github.com/dasta400/dzOS)

## List of programs

* **helloworld.asm** - A test I did to see if *load* and *run* commands work. It prints the expected text.

* **bas32K.asm** - This is the MS BASIC 7.4b NASCOM 32 KB version of Grant Searle published in his [Grant's 7-chip Z80 computer](http://searle.x10host.com/z80/SimpleZ80.html) webpage, with a very tiny adaptation to make it run in DZOS. Please notice that this version, as offered by Grant Searle, doesn't allow to load or save files. You'll have to type the programs manually and it will be lost once you switch the computer.
